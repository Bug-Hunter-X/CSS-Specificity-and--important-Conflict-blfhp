The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, `.parent .child` has higher specificity than `.child`, so we might expect its color to be green.  However, due to the `!important` declaration in `.child`, the text color will be red.  The unexpected behavior arises when you assume the specificity of `.parent .child` would override the `!important` declaration.  `!important` has higher precedence than normal specificity.
