The solution involves removing the `!important` declaration and restructuring the CSS to rely on the cascade and specificity.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Or, if we intend for .child to always override .parent */
.child {
  color: red;
}
```

By avoiding `!important`, we achieve cleaner CSS, more predictable style application, and fewer potential conflicts.
